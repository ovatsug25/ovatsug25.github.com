	<p>When I applied to Phillips Academy, one of the essays asked us to pick three famous historical figures we would like to have lunch with. To describe who I would like to become, I decided I would rather pick three people than say something particularly about what I want to do. There are a few people whom I have to leave out, like Richard Fenyman and Paul Graham, but they still made it in anyway ;)</p>

	<p>Without further ado these three people would be: Bjarke Ingels, David Heinemeier Hanson (DHH) and Steve Jobs. Strangely 2/3 of the group is Danish.</p>

	<p>The qualities I admire most about these people are:</p>

	<p>Bjarke: Yes is more. Secretly conform, and them over deliver. Lead by example.
	David: Pace yourself. Work and enjoy life at the same time. Meet your goals first, then worry about the wow. Do less.
	Steve: Don&#8217;t give up. Don&#8217;t give in. Come back from your mistakes. Understand things.</p>

	<p>I will indulge and add:
	Paul: Mentor and give way to offspring.
	Fenyman: Think straight if I am in a position to do so. Play with things.</p>

	<p>While making this list I find I picked people whose accomplishments and fields I most closely wanted to achieve. Yet at the same time what I listed for their accomplishments are general. None of those are restricted to the specific field they work in. In a sense, this shouldn&#8217;t be surprising but while writing this I am still a little shocked by it.</p>

	<p>As well, it is surprising that most of them are modern. And that I should consider them as historical figures.</p>

	<p>Historical figures are most salient for their accomplishments and little is usually known of their private lives. They also had much bigger ad perhaps harder aspirations such as social order but&#8230;I don&#8217;t know them. I can&#8217;t tell you what they were really like. They are so foreign as to be irrelevant. The were in a completely different context. Plus, the little I have read of what are some of the most attractive figures I could choose from, such as the American founding fathers and the Greek politicians hints that they might have been atrocious individuals in today&#8217;s world. Inventors are missing from this somewhat strangely as I tend to like and value their achievements. But I can&#8217;t think about an ancient inventor whose process I know about. So&#8230;there it goes. My humanity is evident.</p>
