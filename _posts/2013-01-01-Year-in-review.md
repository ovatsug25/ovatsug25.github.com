================

Best that has happened:

### Academic - Get recognized by Edwards
* Quote his email
* Talk about my struggle with him
* Talk about laboring over the keynote
* I worked my ass off for this class.
### Break-Up with Annelise & Decision to Leave School
* I think I behaved very well
* By staying with her through prom, by going to Miami, by going on walks, by being thoughtful, I think I let her know and feel that I love her.
* At first, I though I could, then I didn't think I was going to get over her, then I met Clara and the whole thing was a whole lot easier to digest.
* That email at Thanksgiving thanking her for everything took some weight off my shoulders.
* Her reply made me really proud.
* To this day, and probably forever, because that's how I feel, she will always be one of the people who touched my life the most.
### Family, Divorce and Break-Up
* My mum and I didn't start the year off on good terms.
  As I write this at Ocoa, I feel like it was right here, at this time of the year that I left her room crying. It wasn't actually, but it feels that way. I never recorded it at that time, but my oh-my was there hate and hard feelings there.
  She blamed me and constantly bothered me about the divorce.
  She never listened.
  I learned to accept probably around May, or December when I was here last year that I was never ever going to have a normal relationship with her again. Padre Javier pointed that out.
  It was hard for me to think about it, but I think I learned to accept it.
  But then I tutored the kids in New Orleans…I was determined and really trying to find ways to help them out. I read "How to Talk So Kids Will Listen." I read "Lost at School". I read and re-read and continue to re-read the Paul Graham essays. I continued to look for methods. I signed up for Ramit's courses, I learned more and more about BJ Fogg. I continued to search for the method.
  I read the 'Kazadin' book on how to raise children. I learned about point charts, I learned about rewards, I learned about asking kids for the points, I learned to ask and be stupid, I learned how naive I am, I learned about all the possible ways kids, and in turn adults messed up. I learned about chaos, and reflected on how my past life never had order. Order was my school schedule, but even then, we weren't exactly committed to arriving on time, and in fact, my impulses to get there when I was supposed to were discouraged and other habits were rewarded. To this day, my parents, my siblings, some of my cousins, among others encourage me to do things which on the face of it are like "Cool dude" but in the long run can be detrimental to your way of being and interacting in the world. I don't think my parents grokked the sense of partnership. I don't think my sister understands that either. Both of them tell me that I need to have another girlfriend besides the one I have right now. The suggestion is on the face realistic, yet at the same time ludicrous. It is so short term. Like, of course, going out with another girl would be fun, but, but…you begin to lose out on many things, like having someone actually be there for you, have a real team member, etc. They make it hard for me to think about what is really right, because sure, I can deny them, I can be better, yet, they are my parents. They are still a huge influence and no matter how hard I try to shake them off, I never will.
  All that reading about psychology and habits, behavior and rewards however turned out to be a great investment in terms of manipulating (because they were in a sense manipulated) my maternal grandparents, my mothers and of course myself. I was part of the game just as much as they were.

# Worst that has happened:

# How did I deal with the challenges that I set out for myself:

# What came up during the year

# What am I looking forward to next year:
  * This year I have already gotten a lot better about recording my daily/weekly activities. I usually fill out my iDoneThis every week or so. That isn't the best track record, but it is a huge improvement over nothing. I really like the service and would recommend it to everybody.

  Sunday at 8 am, I will wake up, and write down:
  What I have read during this past week
  What I have accomplished this past week
  How many times I ended up working out in the past week
  Next to that, I will note for how long
  What specifically
  How many times I stretched out last week
  What was my income last week
  How many lunches did I have last week
  I will also analyze my RescueTime and make comments on it
  At some point, I hope to standardize the format and be able to analyze it more in depth.
  This should take approximately 2 to 3 hours.

At the end of the year I'd like to be able to say,

  I worked out 80% of all days this year.
  That would be either 5/7 or 6/7 days.
  Both weekend days should include a workout.
  I should always workout, even if I am in Paris or New York.
  If I am going on a trip, I will find out where I will be running before going.

  I made $20,000 in consulting/freelancing.
  Some of this is already in the making, but I want to be conservative with my numbers before I start charging, plus I see myself studying quite a bit this year and really I want to have money to cover the costs of doing something like HackerSchool and being in Paris for a bit, plus the flights to these places.
  Given that I live my mom/dad/grandmother, I have very few expenses so this should not be a problem.
  It is still a challenge because I'm at zero this year, but that is another story.

  I will be writing. Now, I'm going to sneak this one in by just publishing my reflection for last year. In other words, I will be making my diary public, in addition to republishing a few emails that I have drafted.
  Although I haven't really specified them,

I need to decide on which courses to take for next year. I will make a list.
Right now the plan is something like:
Finish CodeSchool
Finish App for Maritima
Let's see if it is implemented
Blaze through basic Udacity course

### - Personal - ###
Family
New Ritual:
Thurday lunch @Buela and Buelo Chati
Big decline in visits to Casa de Buela as Clara took up more of my time and then work
Begin to realize that Buela's is sort of a posinous environment sometimes.
I never get anything done there at night and everything takes longer than it is supposed to.
She also gets needy, making it hard for me to say no, because I like her a lot and she has been extremely helpful—but like all things, they should be done in moderation and visiting my grandmother falls in that category.
Overall, I have become much better at staying nice but still having a firm no and having time for myself.
