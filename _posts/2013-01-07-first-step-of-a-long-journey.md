================

This is the first of what are going to be many weekly updates on the state of
me.

Guiding principles: "What gets measured gets managed"

"All you need is a trigger"

Writing down what you do tends to clarify your thoughts, thus revealing those to
be truly boneheaded as boneheaded and refining those good ideas which more often
than not have a lot of cruft. I expect to sieve through my plans for next week
at this time.

After doing so, I plan on making "If..Then" statements to prepare myself for the
challenges of the week ahead. "If...Then" statments are not only a powerful
progamming construct for the computer, they are also an incredibly powerful
programming construct for our mind and the schedule we create. At less techy
places people in charge of programming are the schedulers it is for this domain
that I want to use this tool, preparing myself for what is to happen.

The very fact that I am writing this out right now is a result of my "If..Then"
thinking. I decided after reading the "Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg that
this was a pretty nice hack to introduce into my life. And so, I said that every
morning when I wake up, I will log all of yesterday's activities before I begin
my day. This helps me to "reload" the things I was working with yesterday and
allows me jump into work-mode much more effectivley than if I just jumped in all
at once.

I think I should do exercise after logging all of yesterday's activities and
coming back, so I'll make a note of doing so. I should re-read yesterday's log
before getting back to work, though a lot of it will be in RAM if I am running.
I know that I will have to work out by lifting weight later but my health is
okay and I think I need to work on my coding ability a little more for the
moment. I have been pretty bad about just going out and running and may need a
goal to do more of it. Well, it looks like by writing this, I just set one.
Half-marathon in 1:45, courtesy of TrainingPeaks. I had actually already bought
the plan, but delayed doing it until I made stretching a habit which I have done
so. At $10 dollars, if paid in full for a year, this sound like a great bargain.
I could input the workout manually into my calendar, but I have the money and
regard this as a pretty great investment. Joe Friel is a really great guy, or at
least seems like one from his Twitter feed. He also believes in working smart
and I have to give to him, he defidentley has amazing dedication.

I should note that I like getting my calendars emailed to me every morning. By
having this be a special email, I might get even better at filtering the
previous ones.

So how did this week go?

Well, according to RescueTime, I worked for 41 hours and 39 minutes this past
week.

My productivity score was 71% which increased from the previous week. I should
note that in many ways, this is a depressed score because reading
"Agile-Web-Development with Ruby" and looking up the RailsGuides are included as
distractions in this calculation. However, I prefer it that way, because in many
ways, they are not real work.

facebook: down 1:44 from 2:24 to 39:00
ycombinator: down 0:20 from 1:24 to 1:00
stack_overflow: down 17 from 1:17 to 1:00

codeschool: down 7:05 from 9:13 to 2:08
iTerm: up 6:16 from 8:19 to 14:35
macvim: up 0:35 from 4:34 to 5:09
TextEdit down 2:40 from 2:56 to 0:16

Big change as I took the week of Christams to level up, and this last week was
spent on trying to test my application and running Capybara as I try to
implement key functionality into the app I'm developing and preparing for a
January 18th delivery date. Good habits to show good process.

(Also, as I was looking at it, I considered swithcing to Android, or at least
trying it out just because RescueTime is supported on the Android and I do want
to see if I can live with it because what I do on my mobile phone may end up
being incredibly valuable data. Let's see what happens...)



This week, I'm going to continue that development though there is a competing
desire to work on my own website so that I get to publish and put myself on the
web because it looks like I really won't be ready to deliver as I have promised.
In a way this is bad, but it is also liberating. I now recognize what the
problems are between doing it my way and their way, and I am now on the lookout
to overcome them. Not sure how I will settle into this, but we'll see.

Of note, I just registered lazyGeneral at new.ycombinator.com. I expect to see
myself developing this persona by blogging about hacks for the smart and lazy.

This is how I am thinking of my webpages right now:
  -LazyGeneral will be my first REAL design...Let's see how it goes, but I plan to
make it a Codeschool like website with touches, texture and all that other good
stuff.
  -Ovatsug25 will be a copy of Stammy with a little play on Textures and
massaging some of the look.

So what is this week going to look like:

Monday:
  -iDoneThis & banana
  -Workout
  -Shower and eat real food
  -Work through on the CSS, mobile and other to get my website up
    -Buy domains ovatsug25.com & lazygeneral.com
    -Finish codeschool courses to extent possible
    -Push Jekyll pages to GitHub
      -This includes Success Guide
      -Redesigned main page
  -Lunch here at Moms
  -Stay here at Moms

Tuesday:
  -iDoneThis & banana
  -Workout # Where am I on the webpage? Is it up yet?
  -Will probably need to do a little work here on that end, but hope to be in
good shape by now.
  -See webpage deployed

At this point, I need to map out what I need to do for Pro-Forma app a little
bit better, but I've learned that I learn a lot of it as we go.

Things that stand out right now:
  -Testing for the other controllers related to Cargo which I haven't yet
mastered
  -Write a test for every page that just checks the title and some of the
content.
  -Pro-Formas
    -Add ability to email to multiple people
    -Add ship to the Pro Forma
    -Add tabs on the side that let you select the vessel and what the Pro-Forma
for it will look like.
    -Add calculation
  -Play around with Ports
    -Limit to Dominican Ports
    -See Where Cargo is Coming in From this Week
    -See where cargo is going to this week


I took approximatley 1 hour and 40 minutes to write this with some distractions
by Carlos in between. It is now 1:19 am. I meant to write it by 8 am, but wasn't
exactly sure of what it would look like. Glad to see this is happening and
taking shape.

(Continued to 1:40 as I subscribed to TrainingPeaks and calculated mile times
and paces)

Bon voyage!



Considering:
-Android
-JawboneUp
-Jawbone App for iPhone
-iDoneThis
-RescueTime
