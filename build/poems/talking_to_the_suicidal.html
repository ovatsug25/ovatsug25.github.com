<p>Off the phone, with a trembling hand,
Wondering how could it be
How could he say, herd
those thoughts that worry my ear, hear.</p>

<p>Fear I do, that this hoard of
pestilence, the purulent thought
Which has been stored long
Is rotten.</p>

<p>Spoiled it might be, he
Who have I just talked to.
Wondering away all ambition,
In the counterfactual.</p>

<p>Friction, he creates,
With long pauses,
Space, created
To keep us guessing.</p>

<p>And when he does speak,
Like a filibuster,
His diction is dictionary,
Definitions that cover semantic.</p>
