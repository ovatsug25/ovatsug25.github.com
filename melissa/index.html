<h2 id="why">The Why</h2>

<p>I needed a car.
I've also always loved cars, and as the heavens had it a relatively cheap,
good condition manual transmission was on sale.
She was beautiful sure—though perhaps a little rough around the edges.
As I got to know her though, I began to appreciate her deep simplicity, and
from her learned what a car was.</p>

<h2 id="the-purchase">The Purchase</h2>

<p>The Craigslist ad for went like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://gulfport.craigslist.org/cto/4561259841.html">1991 BMW 325i convert., AC and low miles</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The seller claimed 114,000, which was 2000 or so more than when the odometer broke.</p>

<p>The transmission was supposed to be "flawless", and the "AC" a common problem
was supposed to work. Though no longer available, there were numerous pictures
on the car and it looked in general pretty good.</p>

<p>There were no cracks on the dashboard, a common problem with these BMW's.</p>

<p>This made me feel a little bit better about the odometer.</p>

<p>The Carfax said the car had changed hands about 3 times in the past three years.
This made me a little bit more suspsicious. I did not want a car that was breaking
down on me. Now, would I be willing to take that risk, or would I stick with an
automatic manual Toyota?</p>

<p>I began to do a little bit more snooping on the car. I asked a bunch of questions.
Which mechanic was this car taken to? What were their Yelp reviews like?</p>

<p>I looked up the VIN in the <a href="http://www.bmwarchive.org/vin/bmw-vin-decoder.html">BMW VIN Decoder</a>.
Interesting news: the car had originally been an automatic, fabricated at the tail
end of the 1990's. When did it change to manual?</p>

<p>Apparently the owner had been a BMW mechanic himself. Someone had changed the seats,
the transmission, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
Was this a hobby project gone wrong?</p>

<p>To be honest, the fact that the car was in Gulfport was a God's end. It gave
me a little bit more time to think the car through. And when I thought about it,
I was pretty sure the car was going to break down. I was sure about it.</p>

<p>I said no. I wasn't going to purchase it. The car was going to break down on me.
But then something happened…</p>

<p>The owner offered to drive an hour and a half and bring it to New Orleans.
He was gambling on me buying it. If the car could make that trip and still be fine
I was going to be a lot more tempted.</p>

<p>The car did make the trip. Once it was down here, we did a proper test drive of it.
We drove it hard. Took it up to a redline and tried a corner. The suspension
needed to be changed, but I had bargained for that because I was going to be
owning this in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Sometimes you gotta do things by feeling. This was one of them. I took the plunge,
and here I am now, in love with my Bimmer. It was time to learn how to drive it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note if you are going to buy an M version, look it up here:

</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-drive-stick">How to Drive</h2>

<p>Once I got her, I needed to learn how to drive her. My friend Angelica helped
me get her home. Once I got her home though I was on my own.
It took me a bit and it was a little Scary, but I finally learned how to
drive a manual transmission.</p>

<p>Read more about that <a href="/melissa/manual-trans.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="looking-beautiful">Looking Beautiful</h2>

<p>Now Melissa needed a little bit of work. But before I ever got to work
on her, I needed to know how she looked. I needed to learn how to beautify
her. In the car world, this is called washing and detailing.</p>

<p>Larry Kosilla from Ammo NYC explains these in a beautiful set of videos.
Here are my favorites:</p>

<p>[Include Larry Kosilla video's]</p>

<p>His products are a little expensive however. Here's a list of the one's

<h3 id="leather-repair">Leather Repair</h3>

<p>I already mentioned two products I've been using on my car:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meguiar's G10916 Gold Class Rich Leather Cleaner &amp; Conditioner - 15.2 oz.</li>
  <li>Leather Conditioner &amp; Restorer - Leather Nova</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one was convienient (and it does clean and work);r
 the second one has rave reviews from some of the best reviewers.</p>

<p>If you're into getting the right product, check out this review from the
top seller on Leather Honey. It boils down to the fact that car leather is
typically different from regular leather.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Addendum: Some reviewers have noted that Leather Honey didn't soak in to
whatever they were treating, leaving it sticky. Certain leathers,
mainly car upholstery and couches, are surface treated with a urethane topcoat.
It doesn't make it feel like plastic, so you can't easily tell by rubbing it.
Try putting a drop of water in an unobtrusive spot. If the water doesn't soak
in and "wet" the leather within a minute, don't use Leather Honey!
Bick 4 will work, though you will be wiping most of it away. What I use is
303 Aerospace Protectant for leathers that are coated to the point that they
don't absorb water. Note, however, that 303 makes the leather more slick.
Not badly so, but try it first. (303 is great stuff anyway for anything plastic
or rubber or teak, but that's another review …)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using Leather Nova, I found that the leather defitinley feels softer and
more supple. It works. You can see the leather become alive. However, my leather
is in terrible condition. Is it too cracked for conditioner.
Can I fix it, or is a reuploshtery worth it?</p>

<p>These are the two products I've looked into for fixing it. There are enough
rips, tears and cracks to warrant the bigger $60 dollar sets which come pre-mixed
for one color of leather. I may or may not get one depending on the quote
I get from the reupolshterer.</p>

<p>From a forum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chip is the only one on your list that will provide you with any
real gains. Even modded M20's don't make over 200 Hp.
I've often said the way to make a M20 faster is to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Get a chip</li>
    <li>Short shift</li>
    <li>Swap in a better differential</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You need to concentrate on the handling of the car rather than going fast,
if you want a fast car consider turbo, engine swaps or selling it.
You should be able to find a 92 or later 325i or 525i with the M50 engine
in a junk yard and perform a complete bolt-in engine swap
for less than $1500 if you do the work yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy forgot the shocks, springs and control bars. These affect ride and handling.
This is also the one thing you need to look into.</p>

<h4 id="chips">Chips</h4>

<p>My car already has a programmed chip in, but as a programmer and computer geek,
I'd consider the one below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://forums.millerperformancecars.com/index.php?topic=37.0">Programable WAR Chip</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="short-shifter">Short shifter</h4>

<p>Haven't done any research. Car came with the M-shifter.</p>

<h4 id="better-differential">Better Differential</h4>

<p>My car came with a better differential. The owner/mechanic swapped one in.</p>

<h4 id="suspension">Suspension</h4>

<p>There are two kind of suspensions on E30's: coilover and shocks/strut types.</p>

<p>Coilovers allow changes to height. Koni shocks allow changes too.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to purchase a set sometime soon. Most of the aftermarket sets
aim to lower your car, but with the New Orleans asphalt, I'm a little hesitant.</p>

<p>I asked Ireland Engineering in an email and they said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lowering does tend to compromise comfort (and road clearance)
if you've got bad pavement in the area.</p>

  <p>If you replaced the suspension bushings, control arms, shocks and struts,
and shock and strut mounts, the ride quality will be restored to like-new.
I would use Bilstein HD shocks and struts along with the stock springs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will update when I end up getting a new set.</p>
