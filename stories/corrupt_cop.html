    <p>The lights went off right behind us. They had been tailing us for a while. White truck, blue stripes, fabric seats, four camo-wearing passengers with hats seated, two others passengers in the bed stand. They rolled windows down, hands draped over the door, heads poking out. Their mouths were closed and tensed, like dogs about to bark. And now they were behind us, lights flashing, soliciting our stop at the nearest corner by way of siren.</p>

<p>We had first seen them at the colmado, looking longingly while they drove by. My girlfriend, the French girl, said, "Apuesto a que quieren una cerveza como la tuya." I bet they wish they were having your beer right now.</p>

<p>But the hungry don’t want beer. They want to shred meat. Tough and desperate, ready to gnaw at bone.</p>

<p>Turning the music down, Clara's breath throbbed a new pulsating rhythm not unlike the one we were listening to before. But slower, and more drawn out. It was all-absorbing. Her skin was taut. Her paleness lacked the reddish tint it carried below. White, she was blinding and sticking out, breaking a new foreground. The world was dark. Black night. Black people in camo. Black cats. Black wires. Black graffiti. And black dress. Her only likeness was the white of the truck, dead with platitude, justice brimmed out of it. Even my skin looked black then.</p>

<p>Tap. On the door. On the window. I forgot to pull the window down. Just like I forgot to cut my hair. I made an appointment months ago but kept busy, working. Rubios don’t get fired. The president always made people wait. There was something to be learned from him.</p>

<p>Ahead of us was a motorcycle that whizzed past us while I turned down the music. It carried three people. Dressed in uniform—gray and drab. None white. The two in the back were carrying big guns. They got off the motorcycle and arranged themselves on sidewalk and street. In front of my hood, looking at the chrome on the grille. Noticing their reflection, they hitched up their guns a little higher and splayed them wide across their chests. One of the back-of-the-trucks provided the flank. He was looking at my plates in passing, admiring the ribbed texture of the tail-lights. Feature of a new car. This was not the steel-matchbox 1983 Toyota they were getting around in. The metal on this thing had curves.</p>

<p>The guy who rode in the bitch seat was by my window. Tapping. Gun at his side. Looking at the driver of the truck and back at the driver of the motorcycle who was angling his ride just in front of me as to prevent my escape / passage.</p>

<p>Clara breathed heavier, on beat, and took her eyes off the dashboard to take a look at me.</p>

<p>I put my hand on the window control board and pushed down.</p>

<p>The window went down automatically, no need to hold the button all the way through.</p>

<p>Bitch-seat looked around. My dash had back-illumination and displayed the speed in both kilometers and miles. The odometer was very low, at only 10,000 km. The gas tank was full.</p>

<p>On the center of the dash, the air-conditioning was blowing hard, ruffling up Clara's hair, the only movement happening on her body. There was no condensation right below the vents. A fact he would notice. Above it was a screen, read in English, for which he could only make out a crazed woman by the name of Lady Gaga.</p>

<p>There were cupholders, within which rested my iPhone and a clear plastic cup with a bottom of crushed lime, remains of ice, and two straws. There was an open box of condoms, Durex, at the bottom. And there was no hanging crucifix in the middle.</p>

<p>The seats were leather. There was an open-sunroof. And there was even a backwards-playing DVD screen. It took him a few moments to soak it all in. By then, he had been pushed over by motorcycle driver who, was a little bit more tactful, and asked for my license before looking around.</p>

<p>Having lost his position, our former inspector placed his hands on my back-door window trying to peer in. By this point, I was taking up so much time that the guys in the truck shut off the engine. They kept the flashing lights on though before getting off.</p>

<p>I had yet to use it, but I looked at the guy in the guys and said, "Soy militar." I'm military. Technically he was too, probably the product of one of the academies, and assigned to the vestige institution of our former dictator, the National Police. Or perhaps Politur, the only other police agency we have, specially designed for tourists.</p>

<p>At hearing, their face looked like that of a gambler staring at 50/50 odds. Long hair, nice car, out and about on Tuesday night is a cop?</p>

<p>He put his hand on the roof of my ride, gripped and leaned back a little.</p>

<p>Clara's breath stopped momentarily as she looked up and back down. Avoiding the more-than-glances coming at her from the windows in my car.</p>

<p>"Que division?" What division.</p>

<p>This was one of those things I always found funny.</p>

<p>"M-2" (pronounced EHME-DOS)</p>

<p>This was the Division of Naval Intelligence. They worked to curb the travel of stowaways, prevent trips to Puerto Rico, and assisted in the traffic of drugs. And I, at 20, with long hair, was part of it.</p>

<p>Motorcycle-driver looked over his upwards angled shoulder (for the hand still rested on the rood of the car) and back at truck-backseat rider.</p>

<p>"Dizque el es military. M-2" Apparently he's in the military, M2.</p>

<p>Finishing his sentence he let go of the roof, hands following his gaze to a sideways stand and making room for truck-backseat-rider to check on me.</p>

<p>"Do you have ID?"</p>

<p>I pushed my long hair back. And was like sure. I rolled on my side and pulled out my wallet nice and fat, slid out the deck of cards I carried with me, and begun to comb over them. (I must point out that even though I carried credit cards, I refused to use them and paid for everything in cash.) They kept looking at my wallet and not at my comb over. But I still felt a tinge of nervousness before I found that ID. Once I felt the cheap plastic. (The cheapest I carried.) I took my card and displayed it to them. (It was really just a laminated piece of paper)</p>

<p>They snatched it away. And looked. It wasn't the first time I had used it. I was a little embarrassed to pull it out in front of Clara. I was not intending on displaying her this type of message. But I had no choice, and I guess I would be more pissed off if I had to settle it with some other items in my wallet.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, we had done something illegal that night. It came a little later though, after we had stopped by Bellas Artes for the Guillo Perez exhibition.</p>

<p>“I love the reds on this one. There’s real movement here. Expressiveness.”</p>

<p>That was her at the gallery.</p>

<p>I smiled and poked her, pulling her towards me. Pushing her away, I felt drawn towards the next one, “I think this one’s better.”</p>

<p>I gave her a pause.</p>

<p>“Look at the eyes. Just look at them. I could stare into them all day.”</p>

<p>She saw them, but didn’t dive in.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re nice. They’re scary.”</p>

<p>They were a pair of spiraling squares, framed on ellipses which were drawn repeatedly over them and never the same. Their iris blended with the whites of the eye and the cornea was dark and black.  They seemed poked. As if spears had punctured through them. Yet at the same time they felt like the barrel of a cannon: powdered, packed, and loaded.</p>

<p>We went on to the next one, more bright colors, our ever present backdrop and a continuation of that fun touch exchange. The paintings, paired with the free (government-sponsored) wine, they set the tone for a pleasant evening.</p>

<p>In good spirits, we left for the Colonial Zone after we finished. It was a nicer part of the city (to hang out in), with multiple joints and (plain) illumination at the parks and monuments. The fascination with it had the want of a despot, back to the glory days of when our Spanish ancestors took over the island.</p>

<p>One of these illuminated monuments was the Fortaleza Ozama, the fort by the river, built in two stages. One part was Colonial, and the other part was built by Trujillo, the benefactor. The fort was built on a thinnish sliver of land, stuck between two walls at the edge of the zone. We walked alongside the much lower Colonial one, along the unilluminated section, and hopped it as the cops or soldiers ended a round of dominoes in Capicua.  Those games where the last domino can fall at either end of the snake.</p>

<p>Once over the fence, and on the premises of the fort, our only worry was that of the guard who would intermittently walk out to the kitchen to fetch some beverage for the domino players. They would glance at the monument, to confirm that they were doing their job, but being at the monument was like taking the graveyard shift. It was like playing dominoes, but the real catch was in stopping people outside.</p>

<p>Little did they know they would have had as much of a ball if they looked onto the field that night. We rushed the field like running backs and went up the fort tower.</p>

<p>The Ozama river just looked beautiful around that night. You could forget about its pollution. And the in general deplorable scenery around it. When I used to work the docks, the scene from the river was quite a bit different. The hills along waterway were lined with shacks built out of cardboard and tin. There was no running water, so the walls of the household were decorated with the splash of toilet. The kids, somewhat cutely, were usually playing. But it was not uncommon for them to be collateral damage for the gangs that ruled inside. A bunch of the dockworkers would have been embarrassed to call that section of the city home given that during any hurricane, or during a stronger flood the shacks would wash away with them. The economist in me tried to rationalize that this was the first step to become a part of city life, but the human in me was usually appalled.</p>

<p>Today was an easy day to be a romantic though. The shack looked cute, lighting up the hill as if it were a rolling field of Christmas trees (no star on top). As we made it to the top of the tower, I could feel her back straighten from the gasp. (My hand reassuring her that it was all ok from behind.)</p>

<p>French as she was, I could see her thinking that maybe, just maybe those were the reasons for our stoppage—but first-world expectations became third-world naiveté to the visitor.</p>

<p>The cops had walked away from my window and were conferring just behind the last crease of my back-door. ID in hand, they were unsure of what to do. On the one hand, there was that ever-present pang of hunger and their guns. On the other hand here was a white kid with his cop ID.</p>

<p>I had a story ready, in case they asked. I knew enough about ranks to sound legit. And I could, always mention that I work in the intelligence for drugs. I was undercover in the scene, wheelin' and dealin', always lookin' for that next source, that next hit, that next high. The story felt composed. But up until that point I never had to use it.</p>

<p>And I wouldn't have to. Bitch and back-back seat were making their way back to the motorcycle. I could hear the clang of metal as the two hopped right back onto the bed. And there was that big thud of the rear truck doors being slammed right behind us.</p>

<p>Both of the drivers came back to me, with my ID, and handed it back to me. There was no mention that it was expired. But they did paw over with puppy faces, hungry as hell, and trying a different tactic for attention after having been slammed by the newspaper.</p>

<p>Strangely the question never came. Every once in a while you'd get someone with a little more attitude come over and be like—"I'm guessing you uncle or something's a general. FYI, you know, we're here looking out for you. And times are tough man." Wink.</p>

<p>This time they just put out their hand, angled their body away, and went with, "Good night! Have a good one."</p>

<p>"We have orders to stop all cars at La Zona, you know."</p>

<p>Turning my car back on, we drove away, the sirens having turned at the first corner they got a chance to. She was still shaken and pale, and seemed fixed in position. There were bands of sweat across her and you would feel a certain clamminess if you touched her legs, below her skirt, where her arms had rested throughout our little negotiation. I grabbed her knees leaning into the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Looking at her, I asked, “Are you okay?”</p>

<p>Her head rose towards me, plump like watermelon, her pupil shifting as if they were the seeds. I couldn’t see myself in them.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>
